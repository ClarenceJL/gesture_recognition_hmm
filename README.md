#Gesture Recognition Using Hidden Markov Model

Run 'test.py' for gesture recognition  
Note: Change test data path in 'config.py'  
  
Run 'train.py' for training HMM models  

If you want to pre-process the data first, run 'pre_process.py' directly to quantize IMU reading and save the processed data in 'npz' files.
