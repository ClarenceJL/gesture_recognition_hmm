# Gesture Recognition Using Hidden Markov Model

## Data Pre-Process

If you want to pre-process the data first, run 'pre_process.py' directly to quantize IMU reading and save the processed data in 'npz' files.


## Training
Run 'train.py' for training HMM models  

## Inference
Run 'test.py' for gesture recognition  
Note: Change test data path in 'config.py'
